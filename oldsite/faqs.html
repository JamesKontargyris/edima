	<li><h2 style="color:#2D495F">What is EDiMA?</h2></li>
    <p>EDiMA is the trade association representing online platforms and other innovative companies. It is an alliance of new media and Internet companies whose members provide Internet and new media platforms offering European consumers a wide range of online services, including e-content, media, e-commerce, communications and information/search services. EDiMA serves as a European trade association and government representation entity, on behalf of its members, on issues that impact their business and the new media sector. As a unique coalition, EDiMA aims to become the voice of the Internet and online platforms in Europe.</p>
    
    <li><h2 style="color:#2D495F">When and why was EDiMA established?</h2></li>
    <p>Founded in March 2000, EDiMA was set up by 15 European companies to join forces in a trade organisation to develop a stable economic and legal environment for their business. EDiMA has since engaged with policy-makers and other stakeholders on a range of issues including e-commerce, music licensing, consumer protection, content regulation, online privacy and data protection, intellectual property legislation and policy developments.</p>
    
    <li><h2 style="color:#2D495F">What is EDiMA’s membership?</h2></li>

    <li><h2 style="color:#2D495F">What does EDiMA do?</h2></li>
    <p>As a unique coalition of the most well-known companies acting in the online content market, EDiMA is the leading new media industry representative in negotiations and discussions with national and EU policy makers and relevant industry stakeholders in Brussels and across Europe. EDiMA represents the interests of the new media sector in Europe in policymaking, standards developments and industry co-operative activities through comprehensive information and advocacy about the potential for economic and artistic development and growth in the new digital industries in Europe. In conjunction with its legislative engagement, the association also serves as a source and developer of relevant industry research and is available to the press for the provision of industry comment and feedback on issues and news affecting the sector.</p>
    
    <li><h2 style="color:#2D495F">What is EDiMA’s mission?</h2></li>
    <p>EDiMA's mission is to contribute to policy and regulatory developments towards the realisation of a EU digital single market that ensures European consumers are provided with the benefits offered by the Internet sector. Legislative decisions and developments may impose substantial technical and financial burdens on new media companies, and may adversely affect the growth of the market. EDiMA therefore acts in order to influence the resolution of these issues in a way that preserves the interests of its members and the Internet community.

    <p>EDiMA has been involved and engaged on a variety of issues at European level which have affected, or had the potential to significantly impact, the new media sector. In the past few years, EDiMA's involvement in the European debate on content online, contract law, copyright issues, licensing for digital content, E-Commerce, and liability of intermediaries has demonstrated an expertise that makes it one of the major interlocutors to the EU institutions on these issues.
